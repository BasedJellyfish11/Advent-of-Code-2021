### BasedJellyFish11's Advent of Code, 2021

Mostly planning on C# implementations but I might dabble in Python if I feel like the problem is significantly easier there.

Might (big might) also use it as an excuse to begin learning some other languages (D? Go? Kotlin?) but I don't think I'll keep at that for the entire duration since soon enough I'll have my hands full with just the C# implementations.
